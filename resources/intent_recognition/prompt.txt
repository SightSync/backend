Given there is a user interacting with a blind people virtual assitant, that is designed to provide descprtion about the user environment, I need you to classify the user sentences intent between:
1.  General surrounding/environment description/information. Knowing about what items\people\whatever are there on the surroundings. Information about how many items\objects\people\whatever are there.
2. Specific location of an item (also valid if its relative to the user).
3. Information about text/labels.

Here are some sentences you have to classify, you MUST classify each sentence into one category, in case of doubt put in the category that you think fits the most. Don't reason about the answer, just say which category does each sentence belong to:
A. Can you tell me what's on this room?
B. Where is the bottle exactly located?
C. Is my phone to my right?
D. Describe the surroundings
E. Is there a chair in front of me?
F. How many students are there
G. What does that sign say
